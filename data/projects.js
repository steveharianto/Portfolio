            overview: "Ngoper is a web application that connects people who want to ship items with airline passengers who have excess baggage capacity. This system allows for cheaper and faster intercity shipping by utilizing remaining baggage capacity on regular flights. The project includes an informative landing page, registration system, and basic security features.",
            challenge: "The main challenge was designing a UI/UX that made it easy for users to understand the new concept of passenger baggage-based shipping. Additionally, ensuring responsive and consistent display across various devices and integrating Firebase for authentication and database systems presented their own challenges.",
            solution: "I implemented a modular design with Tailwind CSS and React to ensure a responsive and maintainable UI. Components were well-structured to facilitate future development. Firebase Firestore was used to store user data, with appropriate security rules implemented to protect sensitive information.",
            outcome: "The Ngoper website successfully presents innovative shipping service information with a professional and modern appearance. The registration system works well, allowing for the collection of prospective user data for the next development phase. The consumer database grows consistently through the signup form integrated with Firebase.",

            overview: "Inspired by a love for the idle game genre and curiosity about the complexities of their development, this project was an exploration into creating an engaging incremental game from scratch. Players start by clicking to earn coins, then strategically purchase various types of upgrades to automate income per second (CPS). The primary goal is to reach earning milestones to 'Prestige', which resets some progress but grants powerful permanent bonuses, enabling further exponential growth and unlocking new challenges.",
            challenge: "The main challenge lay in balancing the game's progression curveâ€”ensuring upgrade costs, their effects, and the prestige mechanic felt satisfying and motivating, neither too slow nor too fast. Efficiently managing a highly dynamic application state in React (constantly increasing coins, CPS, upgrade levels) and handling potentially very large numbers while maintaining smooth UI performance were significant technical hurdles. Additionally, designing a clear and intuitive user interface (UI) to present a wealth of information (stats, upgrades, charts) was a key design consideration.",
            solution: "Progression balancing was approached through iterative testing and adjustments to cost/effect formulas. React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) were leveraged extensively for reactive and efficient state management within the game loop. Helper functions were created to encapsulate complex logic like bulk cost calculations, prestige bonuses, and large number formatting. To enhance user experience, features like visual feedback (click animations, button progress bars), dynamically unlocking upgrades, and data visualization using Chart.js were implemented. Responsive layout was achieved using CSS Flexbox.",
            outcome: "This project resulted in a fully functional idle game with solid core mechanics: manual/automated clicking, a tiered upgrade system, prestige with permanent bonuses, bulk buying, offline progression, and data visualization. Personally, it provided valuable hands-on experience in complex state management in React, incremental gameplay design and balancing, implementing third-party charting libraries, and focusing on UI/UX details to create a satisfying gameplay loop. The game successfully achieved the initial goal of being an idle game I would enjoy playing myself.",
